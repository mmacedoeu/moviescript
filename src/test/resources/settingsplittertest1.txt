          What's that?

EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE

The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and
a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make
their way into the smoke-filled corridor.

In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers
who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
arms and faces.

An explosion hits near the robots.

          I should have known better than to
          trust the logic of a half-sized
          thermocapsulary dehousing assister...

Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
around the two hapless robots.
